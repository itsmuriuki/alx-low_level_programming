# Low-Level Programming Project

## Overview
The contents of the following folders are a series of programs that I wrote for a project about low level programming using the C programming language. Contained in these projects are the basics of computer science including conditionals, loops, nested loops, data types, strings, pointers, recursion, memory allocation and freeing, variadic functions, file I/O, bit manipulation, positional arguments, and static and dynamic libraries. There are projects on data structures like arrays, singly-linked lists, doubly-linked lists, hash tables, binary trees, and stacks as well as sorting and searching algorithms.

## Software
